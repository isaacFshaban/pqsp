// Colour
//
// A small, intentional palette rather than MUI's default blue: deep navy for
// structure, a teal for "settled/received", amber for "in flight". These map
// directly onto the two transfer statuses, so color carries meaning, not
// just decoration — the brand colour is reserved for interactive elements
// (buttons, links, focus) so people learn what's clickable.

// A brighter tint of the same teal, used only on the login screen's dark
// glass panels (see glassTokens below / GlassCard.tsx). The base teal above
// doesn't clear the 3:1 contrast a focus ring needs against a worst-case
// bright patch of the background photo once blended through the panel's
// tint (checked: ~1.9-2.6:1, depending on tint strength) — this variant
// does (~2.9-4.4:1, see glassTokens comment). Everywhere else — buttons,
// success states, focus rings on ordinary white/paper backgrounds — keeps
// using the base teal; this exists only for text/controls sitting directly
// on the photo.
const tealOnGlass = "#3ABFA8";

// A muted bronze-gold, used only as a small secondary accent on the
// Institution/Bank marks (InstitutionMarkIcon.tsx / BankMarkIcon.tsx) — the
// inner seal ring, the top "keystone" dot, and the keyhole detail at the
// shield's point. Deliberately not the app's teal/amber: those are reserved
// for real transfer-status meaning (see the palette comment above and
// StatusChip), so the marks' navy shield + this gold accent introduce a
// second colour family without touching status semantics anywhere else.
// Chosen specifically because it's visibly distinct from the warning amber
// (#C6820F, saturated orange-gold) rather than a near-miss that could read
// as the same colour at a glance — this is a desaturated, cooler bronze.
const emblemGold = "#B08D57";

// base gold is too close in value to the dark navy login-page badge
// background to read clearly there — see glassTokens below.

//   scrim = black overlay blended over the photo pixel at the given alpha

// WCAG AA threshold — even in that worst case; `accent` clears >=3:1 (the
// threshold for non-text UI like a focus ring) on both. The previous values
// (0.05-0.16 alpha) failed this outright — as low as 1.08:1 in bright areas
// of the photo — and leaned on a text-shadow halo to compensate, which only
// softens local pixel-level noise, not a genuinely bright region of the
